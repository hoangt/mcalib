    Fixed issue with long double types, updated documentation to include instruction to run ldconfig

Michael Frechtling <michael.frechtling@sydney.edu.au>	2014-04-29

    Revised github release to include long double support, (no MCA functionality added for long double only standard IEEE 754 arithmetic to allow CIL modules to cover all cases and avoid build error). CIL now only support up to 1.7.1 to avoid circular dependancy error with 1.7.{2, 3, 3.beta}. Documentation ammended to note CIL support limitations. Test cases for long double methods added to test suite.
